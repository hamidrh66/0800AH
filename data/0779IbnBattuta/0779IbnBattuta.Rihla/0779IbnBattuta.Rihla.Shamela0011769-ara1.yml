90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Very close to the printed edition with no obvious errors. There are a number of images in the printed edition, which are obviously excluded in the text version. From page 190 of volume IV of the PDF printed edition only the odd numbers are scanned; so this part of the text could only be partially checked, but given the closeness of the rest of the text, and that it was possible to check 50% of the pages, it is unlikely to be divergent.
