90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet. See `README.md` for details. 
	Vetting: Tagging was well done globally. I have tagged the poetry, which could be done automatically after fixing one badly formatted poem in vol. 2 pp. 179-81. I have put the first level headers in square brackets as they are not actually included in the edition, and I'm not sure where they come from, but they are definitely meaningful (though closer study should perhaps figure out whether they are actually appropriate). I have untagged the first header (basmallah) and put an empty first header before. The last biography (vol. 5 p. 180) does not appear in the edition. I have now marked it off with any empty first level header, but it may be because the present edition is not actually the same as the one used for creating the digital text (despite the pagination being the same, the metadata in the file is not helpful for identifying the right edition).
